Hackaday Fubarino Contest
=========================

This is an example entry for the Hackaday Fubarino Contest which will be announced at the beginning of December 2013. The contest challenges readers to add an easter egg to their microcontroller projects which displays the Hackaday URL (http://hackaday.com). The goal is to be clever and to document your easter egg.

Elite Clock Easter Egg
----------------------

In this case I whipped up a clock which uses a KS0108 Graphic LCD Display. I'm using [a glcd library driver by Rados≈Çaw Kwiecien](http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/ks0108/). The clock displays the time in a large font (which I produced myself from a TTF font but I can't remember which one).

The easter egg comes in when the time is 1:37pm... or more appropriately 13:37. For sixty seconds the day, date, and seconds display will be replaced with the Hackaday URL.

Let's See What YOU Can Do
-------------------------

Now it's your turn. Dust off one of your microcontroller projects and [put together your own contest entry](http://hackaday.com)!
